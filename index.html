    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p id="about">Hello! My name is Cameron, and I am just a guy who likes to code. 
        I graduated from The University of Washington in 2024 with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Systems.
        I learned about my passion for programming there, and developed several projects that I want to show off!
    <p id="paragraph1">Here is a list of some notable projects I have worked on.
        I have done my best to explain them here, and you can always check my
        <a href="https://github.com/saltcam">Github</a> if you want to look at the code itself!
    </p>

    <div class="about">
    <p>This is a game programmed entirely in Javascript, so it can run in your web browser!
        It is heavily inspired by the game Vampire Survivors, which was very popular around the time we started development.
        I could explain how to play, but I think I will let the game speak for itself, and use this section to share the story of its development.
        I worked on a team with three other students who were remarkably talented and dedicated to making this game what it is today.
        We started development roughly a week after our first class, a bit behind our peers; some of which began development months before the first session.
        We all spent almost entire days at a time coding simultaneously and asynchronously to contribute as much as we possibly could.
        I played a major part in developing the game's systems, every line of code evnetually leads back to my foundation.
        Notable systems I contributed most to would be entity management, GUI elements, projectile system, weapon system, upgrade system, and much more!
        After we finalized everything, we submitted Guy with Scythe alongside a <a href="https://youtu.be/chwJhvlq5kg?si=oUyAunucuvx_Sp84"> trailer video</a> to our class' Discord.
        Each game submitted would be rated by the class, with the most popular games getting extra credit.
        The competition was fierce, several games were in develpoment for months before we began,
        some had completely original (even pre-rendered 3D) graphics made by their teams, some challenged the limitations of 2D gameplay in ways we would never attempt,
        some were also inspired by Vampire Survivors and served as direct competitors to us.
        In the end, the other teams had spoken and declared Guy with Scythe as the best game among the entire class.
        Even in other classes, I heard other students singing its praises during development!
        I have never been more proud of a project since then. I hope that by giving this game a shot,
        you will see the passion me and my team put into making it, as well as the rough edges we did not have enough time to fully polish.
